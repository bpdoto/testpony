I want to start by talking about framing. What is framing? \u00b6 Framing is a way of organizing a discussion or argument. It gives people parameters, a set of agreed-upon guides to work within. When two people talk about \"the metaverse\" in terms of gentrification (see below), they're agreeing to look at the metaverse in a particular light, one in which the reality of gentrification is a given. Framing can also be used in a dynamic, Judo kind of way. Ultimately, the person who frames an argument, the person who gets to say how we're gonna discuss Topic A, sets the tone. I look at framing in this way like playing cards at a friend's place. House rules. In a less aggressive sense, framing helps us understand complexity. It helps us make sense of unfamiliar subjects and situations. In the case of mega-tech and social media, framing can help us see things that would otherwise go unnoticed. \"The Five Levels of Hype\" \u00b6 I was reminded of the importance of framing while reading \"The Five Levels of Hype\" by designer and researcher, Johannes Klingebiel. https://johannesklingebiel.de/2022/01/12/hype-as-a-scale.html Klingebiel states that although hype is regularly understood (and experienced) as \"misleading bullshit,\" hype is actually a bit more nuanced. It's in understanding the nuances where illumination can happen. On the positive, hype can act as a sort of \"glue\" binding developers, investors, and the public in a \"shared vision,\" possibly leading to \"self-fulfilling prophecies.\" That is to say, if you believe it, build it, and bash people over the head with how your thing is gonna change the world, there's a good chance it might actually happen. The shadow, of course, is much more pervasive. The negatives of hype range from \"overpromising\" and \"overselling\" to \"irrational exuberance\" and \"magical thinking.\" Klingebiel's Five Levels of Hype frames the discussion by giving the reader a set of parameters within which to understand what they're experiencing when they experience hype. This has the added effect of helping people spot hype more easily, as well as rate the hype they are seeing. Klingebiel's Five Levels of Hype from least to most egregious are: Level 1: Basic Marketing Standard marketing speak telling you how the thing will benefit you now. \"Why cut paper with handheld scissors, when you could use our gas-powered scissors?\" Level 2: Exaggerated Returns The impact of the thing is overstated and focuses on the benefits you'll have in the future if you invest now. \"We're working on a prototype for gas-powered scissors that will revolutionize the paper-cutting world!\" Level 3: Utopian Futures Focused almost entirely on the future, which, depending on the thing's success will either be utopian or dystopian. \"We're standing at a precipice when it comes to cutting paper. We believe our gas-powered scissors will ferry humanity across unforeseen dangers and into the promised land where all people can cut paper in peace.\" Level 4: Magical Thinking The claims about the thing's future importance are based almost entirely in fantasy land, where the list of problems that can be solved by the thing gets longer and longer. \"Gas-powered scissors won't just revolutionize the way you cut paper. They will fundamentally alter your appreciation of the written word, while simultaneously helping to end illiteracy, famine, wage gaps, and economic disparity.\" Level 5: Othering Allegiance to the thing has become an identity in and of itself. Anyone who believes in the thing is of the living future. All those who do not believe in the thing are of the dying past. \"The GCS community is at the forefront of both technology and human development. In order to realize a decentralized future in which all people can cut paper in peace without Big Brother watching their every move, we must fight against those who wish to keep us in the past.\" Real-world examples \u00b6 When I first read the five levels I immediately started categorizing my experiences of hyped tech, spiritualities, and ideologies into these categories. Here's some of what I came up with: Tech and internet: NFTs (4); The Metaverse (4); blockchain and Web3 (5). Political discourse: Democrats (2); Defund the Police (3); the Right (4); the alt-right (5); SJWs (5). Yoga: Ashtanga Yoga (2); Kundalini Yoga (5). Christianity: Folk Catholicism (1); Prosperity Gospel (2); your very sweet Christian aunt (3); Christian mysticism (4); Westboro Baptist Church (5). Why is this helpful? \u00b6 Because I am first and foremost interested in people and why people do things, I'm less interested in judging the various levels of hype. I have no problem with Kundalini Yoga going all in on Level 5, because I consider myself a relatively astute person who can navigate wild assertions and even participate in them as it suits me. But, I can also leave them when the time is right. Instead, I think framing hype in this way helps me to see more clearly what I'm encountering, but more importantly allows me to make a choice about what I want to engage with. And, that, to me, is the whole point: having choice. Media literacy, as an effect of proper framing, can help a person choose to buy into hype when it serves them. But, they can also choose to untether themselves when it becomes a hindrance. Although it can be tricky to tell the difference, with enough practice a person can get good at being both in the world of hype, while at the same time not being of the world of hype. \ud83d\udce6 Bob is the author of Sitting with Spirits: Exploring the Unseen World In the Margins of Christianity ; The House of I Am Mirrors: And Other Poems ; Acupressure For Beginners ; and The Power of Stretching .

A teacher needs to have... \u00b6 ... a comprehensive understanding of the subject and a passion for at least one hot take within that understanding. In other words, a teacher needs to know what the varying positions are on a subject and why people hold these positions. At the same time, a teacher should also align (even strongly) with one of these positions, but must still be able to validate, articulate, and make space for the other positions. Contrary to popular belief, a teacher need not know everything about a subject or even be an expert on a subject. In fact, it's probably best if the teachers has holes in their knowledge. Not knowing\u2014and being ok with that\u2014is a great opportunity to show students your humanness and will, if you let it, humble you. Humility is an awesome asset to have as a teacher. 2. A teacher must to be able to... \u00b6 ... find a kernel of truth in what a student believes and situate that kernel of truth within the broader scope of the subject. No matter how limited or far off a student's understanding of a subject is, there is always some aspect of either their knowledge base or their emotional relationship to the subject that can be integrated into the discussion. Even a student's unknowing, despondency, or resistance, even these can be turned into useful discussion. When a teacher is able to situate a student's current level of understanding or emotional response to a subject within the discussion, the teacher links that student to the something greater, giving them a place to stand within the discussion of a subject. Giving a student a place to exist makes you a good teacher. 3. A teacher must have... \u00b6 ... great boundaries and the confidence and grace to express how these boundaries function when necessary. You are the teacher. They are the student. The rest of the world can be your playground. Check your baggage and your desires at the door.

My parents were very supportive of my creativity, but had a very narrow understanding of what it meant to be successful as an artist. To my parents, creativity was a hobby. It wasn't something you actually pursued. For them, being an artist yielded only two outcomes\u2014poverty or fame\u2014poverty being the most likely. To avoid this, I was consistently nudged into thinking of creativity as a subject, something to teach, rather than something to strive for in and of itself. What was missing from my parent's understanding of creativity, and subsequently my own understanding, was a third option: making a modest living. They believed art was without a road map toward sustainability. You either got famous or you died in a ditch.

It wasn't something you actually pursued. For them, being an artist yielded only two outcomes\u2014poverty or fame\u2014poverty being the most likely. To avoid this, I was consistently nudged into thinking of creativity as a subject, something to teach, rather than something to strive for in and of itself.

Discovering that there's a difference between the Internet and the web is probably one of the most n00b \"discoveries\" of all time. And, like all n00b discoveries, the urge to over-inflate such a realization is the kind of stoned, conspiracy theory-lite, idiocy that much a parody. (\"Did you know that money is just an arbitrary means of exchange based on a social agreement, and that we could decide not to agree at any time??? This changes everything!\"). So, like, I get it. The realization that the Internet and the World Wide Web are different may not appear to be an earth-shattering discovery, but for the historically web-illiterate, there is power in its simplicity. For anyone interested in having more choices with regards to how they spend their time online, where they spend their time online, and how they want to feel when they spend time online, this simple understanding can act like a skeleton key, unlocking door after door after door. Explaining the Interwebs \u00b6 Most people I know use the term \"online\" as a catchall for whenever they're engaging on the Interwebs. And, to the extent that we use them at all, we tend to use the terms \"Internet\" and \"the web\" interchangeably. This is erroneous. The Internet is the physical network of wires, cables, modems, routers, computers, and servers that make communication across great distances possible. With the exception of WiFi, much the Internet is a tangible network of \"things,\" most of which are buried deep beneath the sea. In fact, 99% of the Internet is not in the cloud, but underwater. Roughly 1.2 billion kilometers of it . The World Wide Web, on the other hand, is not. The web is the information, websites, and platforms we engage with everyday. The web is not a physical thing. The web is a system of programs made possible by the Internet. Chances are, if you're online, you're on the web. Google, Facebook, Instagram, Substack, Reddit, even the notoriously racist and seemingly clandestine, 4chan, are all, by definition and function, a part of the web. All the results you get from searching, no matter how seedy and subversive, are part of the web. Porn is on the web. Conspiracy theories are shared on the web. Even the \"dark web,\" the shady alleys accessible only through Tor, where all sorts of nefarious (and genuinely noble) activities take place, is still part of the web. But, the web is only one of a number of services built on top of and made possible by the Internet. Email and File Transfer are also built on top of this interconnected system of hardwired things. However, not being part of the web, they are inaccessible via web search. You can't Google the email you just sent, not can you Bing the file you just received. You'd be excused if you found this confusing. After all, the website you use to access Gmail and send messages (mail.google.com) is on the web. But, the email you sent is not. The website you use to download the FTP protocol you install so you can send large amounts of files quickly is on the web. But, the mechanism by which the file is sent is not. The web, though a unique service built on top of the Internet, is ubiquitous, and so even when we're not on the web, we're often still engaging with it in some way. Antisocial Internet Services \u00b6 While the web, email, and File Transfer may be the most well-known services running on the Internet, there are a handful of other services that have been quietly doing their thing all these years, out of sight, out of mind. Directory Services, Automatic Network Address Configuration, Network Management Services, and Time Services are all built to function on the Internet. And yet, they too are not part of the web. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-and-its-services/ If you use the Internet for the sole purpose of visiting websites and emailing people, you've most likely never heard of these services before, because without a social component\u2014without providing a platform for people to debate current events or comment on shared images and news stories\u2014there's really no reason for regular users like you and me to access these services. Which is not to say we don't benefit from or engage with them. For example, the Automatic Network Address Configuration provides IP address for every system online in the form of long strings of numbers. We may give these addresses memorable nicknames like \"google.com,\" \"etsy.com\" and \"weratedogs.com,\" but without the ANAC and their assigning numbers off the web, nothing would ever get to where it needs to go on the web. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-and-its-services/ IRCs, Usenet, and the Old, Though Still Very Much Alive, Way of Doing Things Online \u00b6 There are, however, services running on the Internet, that make it possible for people to gather, debate, and exchange ideas, while still remaining off the web.

When I was a kid, it was easy to tell who was legit and who was beholden to mainstream BS. All you had to do was look at their feet and see if they were wearing Doc Martens. Between the ages of thirteen and fourteen, it didn't matter if you were on the baseball team, had a perm, or smiled in your yearbook photo. If you wore Docs (or \"chucks\"), you were someone to know. By the age of sixteen, however, fashion cues became slightly less dominant, superseded by this new thing we didn't have a word for yet: \"context.\" No longer was fashion sense or musical interests the dominant determinate. What mattered was knowing the source: Where did you get your music? Tower Records? Bad. Shows? Good. Where did you get your clothes? The mall? Bad. Thrift stores run out of old mansions in weird parts of town where whatever you could fit into a brown paper garbage bag cost you a buck? Good. The means and ways of acquiring the relevant subculture signifiers were almost more important than the signifiers themselves. Finding \"alternative\" venues and methods for buying, selling and creating was key to the entire indie youth culture operation. It was all about the workaround. Can't play at bars cuz they're lame and won't let you in? Have a show in your mom's basement. Can't get your music released on a \"big label?\" Start your own. In the early days of indie, punk, and hardcore, the \"alternative space,\" the DIY option, and the hack were everything. \"These days\" alternative spaces and platforms are few. The means of production (and promotion) are shared among ideologically opposed groups. Big tech companies, NFT billionaire wannabes, socialists, doom sludge, and underground, punk-Christian anarchists can all be found on the same platforms (ie. Discord, Slack, Twitch, Substack, etc). Both the Beatles and Bog Body share the same real estate on Spotify. Spaces and venues, the contexts we used to rely on to give meaning to what we encountered in the world, have become, like tags in a zettelkasten, weak signifiers. They don't mean anything. So, how does relevancy get determined in a world devoid of spacial context? When all bands use the same platforms to share their music, how do you determine which ones are worth your time? In a world where \"the master's tools\" have been redistributed among the masses, how do you determine which hammer is the hammer that will dismantle the machine? The answer, as usual, starts with Karl Marx. ~ To be continued... ~ Running a Record Label in the 90s \u00b6 Running an underground record label in the 90s was pretty straight forward: Come up with a name Get your friends' bands to record something Look up in the phone book who can print cassettes or CDs or vinyl Make some art for the cover Get the music printed on the medium Sell the record at shows and indie record shops Be diligent about fulfilling mail orders, or Be bad at fulfilling mail orders and get a bad reputation as a scammer Not on the list was \"Getting lots of exposure through mainstream channels.\" It wasn't even a question. Remember: the meaning of a thing was highly dependent on where it existed. And, the meaning of your existence was highly dependent on where you sourced your materials. To market, sell, and monetize your records through mainstream channels was to remove those records from the nervous system of relevancy. The records, no matter the style of music or \"passion\" of the artist, were fundamentally altered by the context in which they existed. When the Means of Production are Free \u00b6 The democratization of the tool hasn't led to an anarchist paradise. It's just made everyone more capitalist.

This, of course, is not what is happening.

It was free. The UI was basic. The instructions were simple but austere. I played it, found it tricky, but manageable, and immediately shared it with my girlfriend. Then I shared it with my stepmom. A few days later my gf shared the first of her wins, and her and I have been going back and forth ever since. I, a writer, am for some reason worse at Wordle. This style of web experience, one that feels intimate, peer-to-peer, and on the periphery of big tech is very much alive. If you can find it. The website is still just a tag at the end of the dev's homepage. https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/ Like anything worth your time, the goods are usually a few pages deep in the Search . There's something about playing Wordle that just feels good. Yes, the UI is distraction-free and opening Wordle feels like you're stepping into the \"old web.\" But, there's something else going on. Something having to do with being a part of a bottom-up cultural experience. It may be subtle and in the background, but when I play Wordle, I feel like the world is working, if only for a few minutes. Even when I'm scratching my head, frustrated that there's no way I'm gonna get the answer in six tries, when I do, I feel a part of a community going through the same experience. Again, it's subtle, but it's there. Unfortunately, this may all be coming to an end . The recent acquisition of Wordle by the NYT for a sum in the low six figs has the potential to turn an otherwise bottom-up, community oriented experience into yet another form of corporate monetization. That's a bummer, and my younger self wants to be angry about it. But, for some reason I'm not. There's something more immediate that's got my attention. The NYT scooping up Wordle gives players an opportunity to see if our collective experience remains when a mega-commercial entity buys a non-commercial, peer-to-peer word-game. Will it still feel like old web, or will it be yet another paywalled, corporate Web2.0 experience? Transitions from underground to mainstream can be hard to recognize until it's too late. If you're not paying attention, corporations can often co-opt non-corporate memes, symbols, and entire subcultures. Sometimes overnight. Sometimes at an imperceivable crawl. One day you're playing banjo at Sunny's Bar. The next day \"clap-stomp-hey\" is on every radio station in the country, and you're all of a sudden behind the times. Giggled at by the same girls who once thought you were edgy and cute. Right now we have an opportunity to observe a transition from non-corporate to corporate. If you've been playing Wordle these past few months, take stock of how you feel when you play it right now. Do you look forward to it? Do you talk about it with your partner? Is it a nice 5-minute break to your day? Then, when it eventually gets re-released by the NYT, see if you feel a shift. See if you find yourself not playing as much, missing days, sharing less. Track these experiences. This is how we go from intellectually \"knowing\" that corporate takeovers of culture are bad, to really knowing. Knowing it in our body. Knowing it firsthand. Knowing it as a felt experience. We may intellectually believe that the mainstream is a culture killer. But, with Wordle being acquired by the NYT, we have a rare opportunity to experience it firsthand. Note: If you're wanting to hold onto some of the otherness you feel from playing Wordle now, you can actually download it and keep it all for yourself. https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2022/2/1/22912711/wordle-web-save-download-webpage-local-personal The Underground vs The Mainstream \u00b6 Great things (great music, art, ideas, fashion) almost always start in the peripheral spaces (in the 90s we would have said \"underground\").
