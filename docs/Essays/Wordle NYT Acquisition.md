# Is the NYT's Acquisition of Wordle the (mini) End of a (mini) Era?
I found out about [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) on a hacker website back in December where, entirely without fanfare, someone posted a link to a new word game. It was free. The UI was basic. The instructions were simple but austere. I played it, found it tricky, but manageable, and immediately shared it with my girlfriend. Then I shared it with my stepmom. A few days later my gf shared the first of her wins, and her and I have been going back and forth ever since. I, a writer, am for some reason worse at Wordle.

This style of web experience, one that feels intimate, peer-to-peer, and on the periphery of big tech is very much alive. If you can find it. The website is still just a tag at the end of the dev's homepage. https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/  Like anything worth your time, the goods are usually [a few pages deep in the Search](**[https://christianheilmann.com/2021/12/20/the-web-starts-on-page-four/](https://christianheilmann.com/2021/12/20/the-web-starts-on-page-four/)**). 

There's something about playing Wordle that just feels good. Yes, the UI is distraction-free and opening Wordle feels like you're stepping into the "old web." But, there's something else going on. Something having to do with being a part of a bottom-up cultural experience.

It may be subtle and in the background, but when I play Wordle, I feel like the world is working, if only for a few minutes. Even when I'm scratching my head, frustrated that there's no way I'm gonna get the answer in six tries, when I do, I feel a part of a community going through the same experience. Again, it's subtle, but it's there.

[Unfortunately, this may all be coming to an end](**[https://www.cnet.com/google-amp/news/thank-you-wordle-its-been-fun/](https://www.cnet.com/google-amp/news/thank-you-wordle-its-been-fun/)**). 

The recent acquisition of Wordle by the NYT for a sum in the low six figs has the potential to turn an otherwise bottom-up, community oriented experience into yet another form of corporate monetization. That's a bummer, and my younger self wants to be angry about it. But, for some reason I'm not. There's something more immediate that's got my attention.

The NYT scooping up Wordle gives players an opportunity to see if our collective experience remains when a mega-commercial entity buys a non-commercial, peer-to-peer word-game. Will it still feel like old web, or will it be yet another paywalled, corporate Web2.0 experience?

Transitions from underground to mainstream can be hard to recognize until it's too late. If you're not paying attention, corporations can often co-opt non-corporate memes, symbols, and entire subcultures. Sometimes overnight. Sometimes at an imperceivable crawl. One day you're playing banjo at Sunny's Bar. The next day "clap-stomp-hey" is on every radio station in the country, and you're all of a sudden behind the times. Giggled at by the same girls who once thought you were edgy and cute.

Right now we have an opportunity to observe a transition from non-corporate to corporate. If you've been playing Wordle these past few months, take stock of how you feel when you play it right now. Do you look forward to it? Do you talk about it with your partner? Is it a nice 5-minute break to your day?

Then, when it eventually gets re-released by the NYT, see if you feel a shift. See if you find yourself not playing as much, missing days, sharing less. Track these experiences. This is how we go from intellectually "knowing" that corporate takeovers of culture are bad, to *really* knowing. Knowing it in our body. Knowing it firsthand. Knowing it as a felt experience. We may intellectually *believe* that the mainstream is a culture killer. But, with Wordle being acquired by the NYT, we have a rare opportunity to experience it firsthand.

**Note:** *If you're wanting to hold onto some of the otherness you feel from playing Wordle now, you can actually download it and keep it all for yourself.*

### The Underground vs The Mainstream

Great things (great music, art, ideas, fashion) almost always start in the peripheral spaces (in the 90s we would have said "underground"). Even the baddest, most awesome corporate sponsored hip hop on the radio (and there's a fair amount of awesomeness there), began in the shadows. At some point, if the thing is deemed monetizable, then the mainstream either acquires the thing, replicates it, or???

For example, breakdancing was (and remains) this dynamic, changing, expressive social binder..... But, when the mainstream started using it for Burger King commercials, it turned it into the bubbly hokey??? If you had only known Burger King breakdancing, as most parents did, then you saw it as a silly... Your experience of breakdancing, everything you knew about it, was packaged by an ad team. It had nothing to do with the thing itself. 

Yoga is a more recent example. Prior to "the boom" in the late 90s and 00s, yoga was a hodge-podge of small studios, based on the teachings of a particular teacher or lineage, that??? Once the mainstream got a hold of it, yoga became watered down,??? Because it was a marketing.... And because marketing at the time was very make it accessible to everyone, as opposed to the more niche market, hyper specific, microtargeting that goes on today, yoga was presented as entirely devoid of parameters. Everything you did was yoga. Cooking your breakfast, raising your kid, bungee jumping. All of it could be "your yoga." Without a Burger King advertisement to promote it, commercial yoga culture went it ahead and did it itself. It became, "have it your way." It became Burger King.
