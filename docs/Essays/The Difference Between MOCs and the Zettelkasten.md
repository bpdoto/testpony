# The Difference Between MOCs and the Zettelkasten
##### 02/16/2022 ‚Ä¢ ?: min

An MOC system (as I am understanding it) can include a zettelkasten, but because the notes themselves do not _require_ internal links within notes, and also makes room for things like to-dos, name resources, etc (in addition to other kinds of knowledge) is really a different beast.

A zettelkasten is primarily a writing tool, though it can and does have other use-cases. But, the backbone of the zettelkasten note (sometimes called a ‚Äúzettel‚Äù or ‚Äúpermanent note‚Äù or just ‚Äúthe note‚Äù) is that it is linked to other notes within itself. This linking is fundamental to the entire project. Here is an example of a pretty standard, if robust, zettel. Mind you, zettels can be a lot smaller:

From top to bottom you‚Äôll see:

1.  tite
2.  the thought/idea
3.  tags
4.  the source and source quote
5.  parent, sibling, and child notes related to this note
6.  what I cal ‚Äújumps‚Äù (links to other notes tangentially related, supportive, or dissenting from the idea in this note)

So, to your point:

> ‚ÄúBased on yesterday‚Äôs discussion with you I‚Äôm under the impression you (may) link atomic notes and explain their relationship within the actual note,‚Äù

I would say, yes, absolutely. That is the nature of a zettel. To link them, and show the link and the context for the link in the note.

MOCs certainly have a place in relation to a zettelkasten, especially if they are used as a sort of global look at developing threads of thought, etc. So-called ‚Äústructure notes‚Äù in the zk community function somewhat similarly in that they can be used to structure arguments, build out ideas on one place, etc. But, MOCs are, by definition, more global in scope.
