# WELCOME
Here you will find a curated collection of my writing. It's not everything. Maybe 10-20%. The rest is strewn about in various corners of the World Wide Web under various assumed and given names. 

Speaking of names, "The High Pony," the name of this web page, is also the name of my weekly newsletter, which you can sign up for [here](https://mailchi.mp/8cc665f9d3f5/sign-up-for-the-newsletter). There, you will find lots of short-form writing about all things humans and intentional. In addition to being a name, "The High Pony" is also a way of being in the world, which you can read about [[here]]. If you're curious about the üì¶ at the end of each article, you can read about that here. And, if you're loving the colorway and wanna know more about it, you can click here. Everything else is either in the header above or below in the form of essays. Enjoy!

### [[How to Be a Good Teacher]]

After teaching in a variety of settings for the past twenty years (public education, college, punk warehouses, living rooms, online Zoom rooms, etc), I have come to believe that there are three core skills a person must have in order to be a good teacher.

### [[Wordle NYT Acquisition]]

The recent acquisition of Wordle by the NYT for a sum in the low six figs has the potential to turn an otherwise bottom-up, community oriented experience into yet another form of corporate monetization. That's a bummer, and my younger self wants to be angry about it. But, for some reason I'm not. There's something more immediate that's got my attention.

### [[Framing and the Five Levels of Hype]]
Klingebiel states that although hype is regularly understood (and experienced) as "misleading bullshit," hype is actually a bit more nuanced. It's in understanding the nuances where illumination can happen.
